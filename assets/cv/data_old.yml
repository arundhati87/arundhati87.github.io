    assignments:
      - title: Sketch Based Image Retrieval
      - place: Computer Vision Center (CVC), Barcelona, Spain
      - technology: Python, Pytorch
      - study topics: Image Processing, Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision
      - roles: Study, Design and Development
      
      - drescription: An approach for multi-modal image retrieval in multi-labelled images. A multi-modal deep network architecture 
      is formulated to jointly model sketches and text as input query modalities into a common embedding space, which is then further 
      aligned with the image feature space. Our architecture also relies on a salient object detection through a supervised LSTM-based 
      visual attention model learned from convolutional features. Both the alignment between the queries and the image and the supervision 
      of the attention on the images are obtained by generalizing the Hungarian Algorithm using different loss functions. This permits 
      encoding the object-based features and its alignment with the query irrespective of the availability of the co-occurrence of different 
      objects in the training set.

      - responsibilities: Studied the factors related to sketch based image retrieval and while developing the network, get to know Pytorch 
      framework very well.

      other methods based on hand crafted features, has the ability to model generic signature forgery techniques and many other related 
      properties that envelops minute inconsistency in signatures from the training data. In contrary to other one shot image verification 
      tasks, the problem with signature is far more complex because of subtle variations in writing styles independent of scripts, which 
      could also encapsulate some degrees of forgery. We mine this ultra fine anamorphosis and create a generic model using SigNet

      framework very well

      - drescription: In various technological and scientific applications, types of coil systems are being used to produce uniform 
      alternating magnetic field. The dimensions of these coil systems are considerably larger than the volume of interest. There is a 
      necessity to reduce the dimension of the coil system without sacrificing the extent of uniformity of the magnetic field. This problem 
      has a wide audience and still remains as a topic of contemporary research in the development of miniaturized devices especially for 
      calorimetric measurements of nano-particles, cancer therapy, and detection of minute surface defects by eddy current probes, etc. We 
      present how we can modify the shape of a miniature solenoid to produce uniform magnetic field. A Genetic algorithm has been
